                    <p>The historical origins of the term "Albania" can be traced back to medieval Latin, with its
                        foundations believed to be associated with the Illyrian tribe of the Albani. This connection
                        gains further support from the work of the Ancient Greek geographer Ptolemy during the 2nd
                        century AD, where he included the settlement of Albanopolis situated to the northeast of <a

                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs">Durrës</a>
                        .The presence of a medieval settlement named Albanon or Arbanon hints at the
                        possibility of historical continuity. However, the precise relationship between these historical
                        references and the question of whether Albanopolis was synonymous with Albanon remains a subject
                        of scholarly debate.The Byzantine historian Michael Attaliates, in his 11th century
                        historical account, provides the earliest undisputed reference to the Albanians, when he
                        mentions them having taken part in a revolt against <a class="link_about" target="_blank"
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1079.[16]
                        Additionally, he
                        identified the Arbanitai as subjects under the governance of the Duke of Dyrrachium.[17] In the
                        Middle Ages, Albania was denoted as Arbëri or Arbëni by its inhabitants, who identified
                        themselves as Arbëreshë or Arbëneshë.[18] Albanians employs the terms Shqipëri or Shqipëria when
                        referring to their nation, designations that trace their historical origins to the 14th
                        century.[19] <span>However, it was not until the late 17th and early 18th centuries that these
                            terms
                            gradually superseded Arbëria and Arbëreshë among the Albanians.[19][20] These two
                            expressions
                            are widely interpreted to symbolise "Children of the Eagles" and "Land of the Eagles"

                <div class="prehistory">
                    <p>Mesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air sites which during that
                        period were close to the Adriatic coastline and in cave sites. Mesolithic objects found in a
                        cave near Xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those
                        discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the Aurignacian
                        culture.[23] The Neolithic era in Albania began around 7000 BCE and is evidenced in finds which
                        indicate domestication of sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture. <br> A part of the
                        Neolithic
                        population may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the southern Balkans like in
                        the Konispol cave where the Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic finds.
                        Cardium pottery culture appears in coastal Albania and across the Adriatic after 6500 BCE, while
                        the settlements of the interior took part in the processes which formed Starčevo culture.
                        The Indo-Europeanization of Albania in the context of the IE-ization of the western Balkans
                        began after 2800 BCE. The presence of the Early Bronze Age tumuli in the vicinity of later
                        Apollonia dates to 2679±174 calBCE (2852-2505 calBCE). These burial mounds belong to the
                        southern expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later Cetina culture) which
                        moved southwards along the Adriatic from the northern Balkans. The same community built similar
                        mounds in Montenegro (Rakića Kuće) and northern Albania (Shtoj).[25] The first archaeogenetic
                        find related to the IE-ization of Albania involves a man with predominantly Yamnaya ancestry
                        buried in a tumulus of northeastern Albania which dates to 2663–2472 calBCE.[26] During the
                        Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds appear in Albania. Cetina culture moved
                        southwards across the Adriatic from the Cetina valley of Dalmatia. In Albania, Cetina finds are
                        concentrated around southern Lake Shkodër and appear typically in tumulus cemeteries like in
                        Shkrel and Shtoj and hillforts like Gajtan (Shkodër) as well as cave sites like Blaz, Nezir and
                        Keputa (central Albania) and lake basin sites like Sovjan (southeastern Albania)
