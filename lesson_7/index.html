                <p>A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and the sea. The sea commonly refers
                    to the ocean, the wider body of seawater. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order
                    sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies
                    of water.</p>
                <p>The salinity of water bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large
                    rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts
                    vary little across the oceans. The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride. The
                    water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other
                    elements, some in minute concentrations.</p>
                <p>A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and animals, lives
                    in the seas, which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from
                    the sunlit surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone,
                    and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the warm waters of coral reefs in
                    tropical regions. Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started
                    there.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part_2">
                <p>The sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the Atlantic,
                    Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans.[1] However, the word "sea" can also be used for many
                    specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp
                    distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as
                    marginal seas or particularly as a mediterranean sea) or wholly (as inland seas) enclosed by
                    land.[2]</p>
                <p>However, an exception to this is the Sargasso Sea which has no coastline and lies within a circular
                    current, the North Atlantic Gyre.[3]:â€Š90â€Š Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt
                    water, but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake.[4][a] The United Nations Convention on the Law
                    of the Sea states that all of the ocean is "sea"</p>
            </div>
            <div class="part_3">
                <p>Earth is the only known planet with seas of liquid water on its surface,[3]:â€Š22â€Š although Mars
                    possesses ice caps and similar planets in other solar systems may have oceans.[11] Earth's
                    1,335,000,000 cubic kilometers (320,000,000 cu mi) of sea contain
                    Wind blowing over the surface of the sea causes friction at the interface between air and sea. Not
                    only does this cause waves to form, but it also makes the surface seawater move in the same
                    direction as the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a
                    single direction and thus a surface current can be formed.</p>
