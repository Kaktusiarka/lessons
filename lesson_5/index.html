            <p>
                From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
                This article is about meetings in general. For meetings in organizations that use parliamentary
                procedure, see Meeting (parliamentary procedure). For multi-event athletic competitions, see Track and
                field § Meetings.
                A meeting is when two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or
                business setting, but meetings also occur in a variety of other environments. Meetings can be used as
                form of group decision making.

            Definition
        </h3>
        <div class="text2">
            <p>
                A meeting is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the purpose of achieving a
                common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement.[1] Meetings
                may occur face-to-face or virtually, as mediated by communications technology, such as a telephone
                conference call, a skyped conference call or a videoconference. One Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a
                meeting as "an act or process of coming together" - for example "as [...] an assembly for a common
                purpose [...]".[2]
                <span>
                    Meeting planners and other meeting professionals may use the term "meeting" to denote an event
                    booked at
                    a hotel, convention center or any other venue dedicated to such gatherings.[1][3]
                    Anthropologist Helen B. Schwartzman defines a meeting as "a communicative event involving three or
                    more
                    people who agree to assemble for a purpose ostensibly related to the functioning of an organization
                    or
                    group."[4] For her, meetings are characterized by "multiparty talk that is episodic in nature, and
                    participants either develop or use specific conventions for regulating this talk."[4]
                </span>

            Types
        </h3>
        <div class="text3">
            <p>
                The term "meeting" may refer to a lecture (one presentation), seminar (typically several presentations,
                small audience, one day), conference (mid-size, one or more days), congress (large, several days),
                exhibition or trade show (with staffed stands being visited by passers-by), workshop (smaller, with
                active participants), training course, team-building session and kick-off event.
                Common types of meeting include:
                Committee meeting, a coming-together of a defined subset of an organization
                Investigative meeting, generally when conducting a pre-interview, exit interview or a meeting among the
                investigator and representative
                Kickoff meeting, the first meeting with a project team and the client of the project to discuss the role
                of each team-member[5]
                Town hall meeting, an informal public gathering.
                Work meeting, which produces a product or intangible result such as a decision;[6] compare working
                group.
                Board meeting, a meeting of the board of directors of an organization
                Management meeting, a meeting among managers
                Staff meeting, typically a meeting between a manager and those that report to that manager
                Team meeting, in project contexts - a meeting among colleagues working on various aspects of a team
                project.
                Other varieties include breakfast meetings[7] off-site meetings (or Awayday meetings in the UK), and
                "stand-up meetings" where participants stand up to encourage brevity.
                Since a meeting can be held once or often, the meeting organizer has to determine the repetition and
                frequency of occurrence of the meeting: one-time, recurring meeting, or a series meeting such as a
                monthly "lunch and learn" event at a company, church, club or organization in which the placeholder is
                the same, but the agenda and topics to be covered vary.[citation needed] In Russian, a "flying meeting"
                (Russian: летучий митинг, romanized: letuchij miting) is a hastily called brief meeting.[8]
